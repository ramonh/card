It's me, Ram√≥n! Special thanks to [Tierney](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang) for making this awesomeness

# Usage

## npm
```
npx ramonh
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @ramonh/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
